                The project aims to put web development skills into practical use. The application is written in pure JavaScript and runs in a Node.js environment, without using additional frameworks such as Express.js or Fetch API. This choice was intentional â€” it allowed for a deeper understanding of how routing, servers, and request handling work in pure code. The application supports routing between different views and uses the external JSONPlaceholder API to fetch and display data. The code is designed to be modular and reusable, which improves readability, simplifies maintenance, and eliminates unnecessary duplication of functions. The project demonstrates the ability to build a fully functional web application based on core JavaScript mechanisms and good practices in code organization and working with external APIs.
